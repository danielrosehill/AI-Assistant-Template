# Readme Page For Your AI Assistant

Another idea is to create a code snippet for a reusable README Texts that can be used when open sourcing assistant configurations or providing them in internal repository management systems. 

You can use a structure similar to this:

## Assistant Name

[The name of the assistant]

## Assistant URL (Production)

[The live URL of the assistant]

## Assistant Embed Code

[Code fences containing embed code for embedding the Assistant in a internal system. This might be an iframe, for example]

## Assistant Version

[Latest version number of the Assistant]
